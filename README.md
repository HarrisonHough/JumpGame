# Jump Game
A simple 2D platform game made in Unity 3D

## Description
This game targeted for Mobile devices using a very simple 1 tough/tap type controls. I created this just as a short sprint for a bit of practice. Currently it is using art assets that are not my own but I will update once I finish my own.
